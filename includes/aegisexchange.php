        Aegis Exchange: A Comprehensive Security Vendor Marketplace
      </h2>
      <p class="aegisexchange-text-p">
        Aegis Exchange is a specialized web application designed to connect security professionals with a global network of security vendors across various regions. The platform offers an intuitive interface for browsing security service providers organized by geographic regions and service categories.
      </p>
      <p class="aegisexchange-text-p">
        Built with a hybrid PHP/MySQL architecture, Aegis Exchange demonstrates thoughtful design in its implementation of a specialized business-to-business marketplace. The system features a sophisticated interactive 3D globe visualization that allows users to explore vendors geographically, complemented by a traditional list-based interface for convenient browsing.
      </p>
      <p class="aegisexchange-text-p">
        The frontend leverages modern web technologies including JavaScript for interactive elements, with impressive integration of third-party libraries like Globe.gl for the interactive world map. The implementation shows expertise in DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous data fetching through well-structured API endpoints.
      </p>
      <p class="aegisexchange-text-p">
        The backend architecture demonstrates proficiency in RESTful API design with dedicated endpoints for vendor data retrieval and filtering. The system includes robust user authentication, account management with role-based permissions (client/vendor distinctions), and thoughtful email verification flows that enhance platform security.
