        Custom Quizzes is an educational platform that allows users to
        design their own multiple choice question quizzes. The website
        includes an example quiz, The Logical Fallacy Quiz, that allows
        users to identify and understand common logical fallacies in
        everyday arguments. Users may test their skills by choosing the
        correct name or description of any number of logical fallacies.
